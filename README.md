# Dotfiles

The basic configuration bits that my favorite tools use. These days, a
lot of stuff goes in `~/.config/` it seems.

## Use

```shell
git clone git@github.com:sduckett/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
make init
```

## TODO

- [ ] write a Makefile and whatever tools make it easy to get a system online QUICKLY.
